# What is Node.js and Why Use It?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side.

Traditionally, JavaScript was used only inside browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge), but Node.js makes it possible to use JavaScript to build backend services, APIs, command-line tools, and even desktop or mobile applications.
